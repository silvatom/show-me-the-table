# show-me-the-table
Simple project to present a multiplication table

## Makefile
Makefile rules:
* ```make``` : Compile the program.
* ```make clean``` : Remove the objects compiled to make the program.
* ```make fclean``` : Clear the objetcs and the binary.

## Use the program
After using ```make```, it'll apear a binary called "*program*". Execute it using ```./program```.
NOTE: The binary's name can be changed in the Makefile's variable "**NAME**"

A prompt will be given to you. Enter the multiplication table you desire and see the output.

## Next steps
* Better input validation
